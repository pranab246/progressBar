Thanks for contributing to progressBar!

We love pull requests, they're our favorite.

However, before submitting, please review the following:

 - Please maintain consistent whitespace - Tab indentation, trailing newlines in all files, etc.
 - Any time you make a change to your PR, please rebase freshly on top of master. Nobody likes merge commits.

Even if you don't have all of these items covered, please still feel free to submit a PR! Someone else may be inspired and volunteer to complete it for you.

Thanks again!
